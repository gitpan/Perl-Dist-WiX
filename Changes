Changes for Perl extension Perl-Dist-WiX

0.1401  Wed 25 Feb 2009
	1. Got bit by new indexing rules implemented as of
	   December 2008, so creating tar file with correct
	   permissions.

0.14    Wed 25 Feb 2009
    1. Got rid of warning at Directory.pm around line 416
	   (using comparison with result of Scalar::Util::blessed 
	   instead of Params::Util::_INSTANCE because _INSTANCE 
	   returns undef, rather than a numeric.)

0.13_04 Mon 23 Feb 2009
	1. Added PDWiX::Parameter error class
	2. Added packlist parameter to install_module
	   and install_distribution
	3. Added DirectoryTree->add_root_directory.
	
0.13_03 Fri 20 Feb 2009
    1. Internals use Object::InsideOut (I have to admit 
	   I was getting confused with all the inheritance.)
	   Perl::Dist::WiX[::Installer] still uses Object::Tiny
	   for backwards compatibility.
	2. Exception::Class also used (Makes it so errors 
	   change along with the trace level.)
	   Note that errors generated by Perl::Dist::WiX are 
	   in the PDWiX class.
	3. Tests reordered and categorized.

0.13_02 Thu 12 Feb 2009
    1. Test sequence completed. Passes, as well.

0.13_01 Mon 02 Feb 2009 
    1. Generates .msi file!
    2. Added routines to help make sure all files are installed.
    3. Updated to go with Perl::Dist 1.12 and Perl::Dist::Strawberry 1.09
    4. Icons handled.

0.11_07 Tue 27 Jan 2009
    1. Documentation completed.
    2. Trace now has 6 (0-5) levels.
    3. Directory creation simplified. (hopefully bug-free)
    4. Still no .msi yet.

0.11_06 Wed 21 Jan 2009
    1. Moved Feature.pm up one level, created FeatureTree.pm.   
    2. Spelling, a little documentation, bug fixes, tests.
       (more in _07)
    3. CPAN icon, get_component_array methods, build number, 
       beta number, and msi parameters added.
    4. Updated Perl::Dist::WiX to match Perl::Dist::Inno 1.11
    5. Creating all .wixout files required - but no .msi yet 
       (files are being counted twice)
    
0.11_05 Mon 19 Jan 2009
    1. Work in progress debugging routines install_win32_extras needs
    2. Documentation of some low-level modules added
    3. Compile test updated with all modules.
    4. Other tests skipped until rewriting done.
    5. Some parameter-checking added.

0.11_04 Sat 17 Jan 2009
    - Verified generation of fragments up to step 4 
      (install_perl_modules) now. (84 fragments, 900K)
    - Removed P::D::W::Toolchain, replaced it with ad-hoc
      _name_to_module method (I want to affect Perl::Dist 
      itself as little as possible)
    - Added more to list of modules that leave .packlist 
      files to check.
    - Removed create_string_fragment method (not being used)

0.11_03 Sat 17 Jan 2009
    - perl, the perl licenses, and the individual 
      modules of the Perl toolchain are now tested
      to generate fragments (now 57 fragments, about 
      800K .wxs source.)
    - Perl::Dist::WiX::Filelist module added to handle
      file list arithmetic and operations.
      
0.11_02 Thu 15 Jan 2009
    - First actual code:
      1: Most routines collect file names
      2: "low-level" routines create strings that 
         "work up the line" and get assembled.
      3: Individual portions of the C toolchain are
         individual wix fragments.

0.01_01 Sun 12 Oct 2008
