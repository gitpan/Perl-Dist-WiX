NAME
    Perl::Dist::WiX - Experimental 4th generation Win32 Perl distribution
    builder

VERSION
    This document describes Perl::Dist::WiX version 0.170.

DESCRIPTION
    This package is the experimental upgrade to Perl::Dist based on Windows
    Install XML technology, instead of Inno Setup.

    Perl distributions built with this module have the option of being
    created as Windows Installer databases (otherwise known as .msi files)

SYNOPSIS
            # Sets up a distribution with the following options
            my $distribution = Perl::Dist::WiX->new(
                    msi               => 1,
                    trace             => 1,
                    build_number      => 1,
                    cpan              => URI->new(('file://C|/minicpan/')),
                    image_dir         => 'C:\myperl',
                    download_dir      => 'C:\cpandl',
                    output_dir        => 'C:\myperl_build',
                    temp_dir          => 'C:\temp',
                    app_id            => 'myperl',
                    app_name          => 'My Perl',
                    app_publisher     => 'My Perl Distribution Project',
                    app_publisher_url => 'http:/myperl.invalid/',
                    msi_directory_tree_additions => [ qw(
                      c\bin\program
                      perl\lib\Acme
                    )],
            );

            # Creates the distribution
            $bb->run();

INTERFACE
  new
    The new method creates a new Perl Distribution build as an object.

    Each object is used to create a single distribution, and then should be
    discarded.

    Although there are about 30 potential constructor arguments that can be
    provided, most of them are automatically resolved and exist for
    overloading puposes only, or they revert to sensible defaults and
    generally never need to be modified.

    This routine may take a few minutes to run.

    An example of the most likely attributes that will be specified is in
    the SYNOPSIS.

    Attributes that are required to be set are marked as *(required)* below.
    They may often be set by subclasses.

    *   image_dir *(required)*

        Perl::Dist::WiX distributions can only be installed to fixed paths
        as of yet.

        To facilitate a correctly working CPAN setup, the files that will
        ultimately end up in the installer must also be assembled under the
        same path on the author's machine.

        The "image_dir" method specifies the location of the Perl install,
        both on the author's and end-user's host.

        Please note that this directory will be automatically deleted if it
        already exists at object creation time. Trying to build a Perl
        distribution on the SAME distribution can thus have devastating
        results.

    *   temp_dir

        Perl::Dist::WiX needs a series of temporary directories while it is
        running the build, including places to cache downloaded files,
        somewhere to expand tarballs to build things, and somewhere to put
        debugging output and the final installer zip and exe files.

        The "temp_dir" param specifies the root path for where these
        temporary directories should be created.

        For convenience it is best to make these short paths with simple
        names, near the root.

        This parameter defaults to a subdirectory of $ENV{TEMP} if not
        specified.

    *   force

        The "force" parameter determines if perl and perl modules are tested
        upon installation. If this parameter is true, then no testing is
        done.

    *   trace

        The "trace" parameter sets the level of tracing that is output.

        Setting this parameter to 0 prints out only MAJOR stuff and errors.

        Setting this parameter to 2 or above will print out the level as the
        first thing on the line, and when an error occurs and an exception
        object is printed, a stack trace will be printed as well.

        Setting this parameter to 3 or above will print out the filename and
        line number after the trace level on those lines that require a
        trace level of 3 or above to print.

        Setting this parameter to 5 or above will print out the filename and
        line number on every line.

        Default is 1 if not set.

    *   perl_version

        The "perl_version" parameter specifies what version of perl is
        downloaded and built. Legal values for this parameter are '588',
        '589', and '5100' (for 5.8.8, 5.8.9, and 5.10.0, respectively.)

        This parameter defaults to '5100' if not specified.

    *   cpan

        The "cpan" param provides a path to a CPAN or minicpan mirror that
        the installer can use to fetch any needed files during the build
        process.

        The param should be a URI object to the root of the CPAN repository,
        including trailing slash.

        If you are online and no "cpan" param is provided, the value will
        default to the <http://cpan.strawberryperl.com> repository as a
        convenience.

    *   portable

        The optional boolean "portable" param is used to indicate that the
        distribution is intended for installation on a portable storable
        device. This creates a distribution in zip format.

    *   zip

        The optional boolean "zip" param is used to indicate that a zip
        distribution package should be created.

    *   msi

        The optional boolean "msi" param is used to indicate that a Windows
        Installer distribution package (otherwise known as an msi file)
        should be created.

    *   exe

        The optional boolean "exe" param is unused at the moment.

    *   checkpoint_after

        Stops the installation at the stage that has this number.

    *   checkpoint_before

        Starts a saved installation at the stage that has this number.

    *   app_id *(required)*

        The "app_id" parameter provides the base identifier of the
        distribution that is used in constructing filenames. This must be a
        legal Perl identifier (no spaces, for example) and is required.

    *   app_name *(required)*

        The "app_name" parameter provides the name of the distribution. This
        is required.

    *   app_publisher *(required)*

        The "app_publisher" parameter provides the publisher of the
        distribution.

    *   app_publisher_url *(required)*

        The "app_publisher_url" parameter provides the URL of the publisher
        of the distribution.

    *   default_group_name

        The name for the Start menu group this program installs its
        shortcuts to. Defaults to app_name if none is provided.

    *   msi_debug

        The optional boolean "msi_debug" parameter is used to indicate that
        a debugging MSI (one that creates a log in $ENV{TEMP} upon execution
        in Windows Installer 4.0 or above) will be created if "msi" is also
        true.

    *   build_number *(required)*

        The required integer "build_number" parameter is used to set the
        build number portion of the distribution's version number, and is
        used in constructing filenames.

    *   beta_number

        The optional integer "beta_number" parameter is used to set the beta
        number portion of the distribution's version number (if this is a
        beta distribution), and is used in constructing filenames.

        It defaults to 0 if not set, which will construct distributions
        without a beta number.

    *   msi_license_file

        The optional "msi_license_file" parameter specifies the location of
        an .rtf or .txt file to be displayed at the point where the MSI asks
        you to accept a license.

        Perl::Dist::WiX provides a default one if none is supplied here.

    *   msi_banner_top

        The optional "msi_banner_top" parameter specifies the location of a
        493x58 .bmp file that is used on the top of most of the dialogs in
        the MSI file.

        WiX will use its default if no file is supplied here.

    *   msi_banner_side

        The optional "msi_banner_side" parameter specifies the location of a
        493x312 .bmp file that is used in the introductory dialog in the MSI
        file.

        WiX will use its default if no file is supplied here.

    *   msi_help_url

        The optional "msi_help_url" parameter specifies the URL that
        Add/Remove Programs directs you to for support when you click the
        "Click here for support information." text.

    *   msi_readme_file

        The optional "msi_readme_file" parameter specifies a .txt or .rtf
        file or a URL (TODO: check) that is linked in Add/Remove Programs in
        the "Click here for support information." text.

    *   msi_product_icon

        The optional "msi_product_icon" parameter specifies the icon that is
        used in Add/Remove Programs for this MSI file.

    *   msi_directory_tree_additions

        The optional "msi_directory_tree_additions" parameter is a reference
        to an array of directories under image_dir (i.e. perl\lib\Module, as
        opposed to C:\distribution\perl\lib\module) that need to be in the
        initial directory tree because they are used by more than one
        fragment.

        If upon running the distribution module, you see LGHT0091 or
        LGHT0130 errors at the end that refer to directories, add the
        applicable directories to this parameter.

    The "new" constructor returns a Perl::Dist::WiX object, which you should
    then call "run" on to generate the distribution.

  Accessors
            $id = $dist->bin_candle;

    Accessors will return a specified portion of the distribution state.

    If it can also be set as a parameter to "new", it is marked as *(also
    "new" parameter)* below.

   binary_root
    *(also "new" parameter)*

    The "binary_root" accessor returns the URL (as a string, not including
    the filename) where the distribution will be uploaded.

    Defaults to 'http://strawberryperl.com/package'.

   modules_dir
    *(also "new" parameter)*

    The directory where the modules for the distribution will be downloaded
    to.

    Defaults to "download_dir" . '\modules'.

   license_dir
    *(also "new" parameter)*

    The subdirectory of image_dir where the licenses for the different
    portions of the distribution will be copied to.

    Defaults to "image_dir" . '\licenses'.

   build_dir
    *(also "new" parameter)*

    The directory where the source files for the distribution will be
    extracted and built from.

    Defaults to "temp_dir" . '\build'.

   checkpoint_dir
    *(also "new" parameter)*

    The directory where Perl::Dist::WiX will store its checkpoints.

    Defaults to "temp_dir" . '\checkpoint'.

   bin_perl, bin_make, bin_pexports, bin_dlltool
    The location of perl.exe, dmake.exe, pexports.exe, and dlltool.exe.

    These only are available (not undef) once the appropriate packages are
    installed.

   env_path
    An arrayref storing the different directories under "image_dir" that
    need to be added to the PATH.

   debug_stdout, debug_stderr
    The files where STDOUT and STDERR is redirected to to receive the output
    of make and perl.

    Defaults to "output_dir" . '\debug.out' and "output_dir" . '\debug.err'

   perl_version_corelist
    A hash containing the versions of the core modules in the version of
    perl being distributed. Retrieved from Module::Corelist.

   output_file
    The list of distributions created as an array reference.

   filters
    Provides an array reference of files and directories that will not be
    installed.

    Initialized in "new".

   dist_dir
    Provides a shortcut to the location of the shared files directory.

    Returns a directory as a string or throws an exception on error.

   offline
    The Perl::Dist module has limited ability to build offline, if all
    packages have already been downloaded and cached.

    The connectedness of the Perl::Dist object is checked automatically be
    default using LWP::Online. It can be overidden by providing an offline
    param to the constructor.

    The "offline" accessor returns true if no connection to "the internet"
    is available and the object will run in offline mode, or false
    otherwise.

   download_dir
    *(also "new" parameter)*

    The "download_dir" accessor returns the path to the directory that
    packages of various types will be downloaded and cached to.

    An explicit value can be provided via a "download_dir" param to the
    constructor. Otherwise the value is derived from "temp_dir".

   image_dir
    *(also "new" parameter)*

    The "image_dir" accessor returns the path to the built distribution
    image. That is, the directory in which the build C/Perl code and modules
    will be installed on the build server.

    At the present time, this is also the path to which Perl will be
    installed on the user's machine via the "source_dir" accessor, which is
    an alias to the Perl::Dist::WiX::Installer method "source_dir".
    (although theoretically they can be different, this is likely to break
    the user's Perl install)

   perl_version
    The "perl_version" accessor returns the shorthand perl version as a
    string (consisting of the three-part version with dots removed).

    Thus Perl 5.8.8 will be "588" and Perl 5.10.0 will return "5100".

   perl_version_literal
    The "perl_version_literal" method returns the literal numeric Perl
    version for the distribution.

    For Perl 5.8.8 this will be '5.008008', Perl 5.8.9 will be '5.008009',
    and for Perl 5.10.0 this will be '5.010000'.

   perl_version_human
    The "perl_version_human" method returns the "marketing" form of the Perl
    version.

    This will be either '5.8.8', '5.8.9' or '5.10.0'.

  run
    The "run" method is the main method for the class.

    It does a complete build of a product, spitting out an installer.

    Returns true, or throws an exception on error.

    This method may take an hour or more to run.

  Routines used by "run"
   install_custom
    The "install_custom" method is an empty install stub provided to allow
    sub-classed distributions to add vastly different additional packages on
    top of Strawberry Perl.

    For example, this class is used by the Parrot distribution builder
    (which needs to sit on a full Strawberry install).

    Notably, the "install_custom" method comes AFTER "remove_waste", so that
    the file deletion logic in "remove_waste" won't accidntally delete files
    that may result in a vastly more damaging effect on the custom software.

    Returns true, or throws an error on exception.

   install_c_toolchain
    The "install_c_toolchain" method is used by "run" to install various
    binary packages to provide a working C development environment.

    By default, the C toolchain consists of dmake, gcc (C/C++), binutils,
    pexports, the mingw runtime environment, and the win32api C package.

    Although dmake is the "standard" make for Perl::Dist distributions, it
    will also install the mingw version of GNU make for use with those
    modules that require it.

   install_c_libraries
    The "install_c_libraries" method is an empty install stub provided to
    allow sub-classed distributions to add vastly different additional
    packages on top of Strawberry Perl.

    Returns true, or throws an error on exception.

   install_perl_* (* = 588, 589, or 5100)
            $self->install_perl_5100;

    The "install_perl_*" method provides a simplified way to install Perl
    into the distribution.

    It takes care of calling "install_perl_*_bin" with the standard params,
    and then calls "install_perl_toolchain" to set up the CPAN toolchain.

    Returns true, or throws an exception on error.

   install_perl_*_bin
            $self->install_perl_5100_bin(
              name       => 'perl',
              dist       => 'RGARCIA/perl-5.10.0.tar.gz',
              unpack_to  => 'perl',
              license    => {
                      'perl-5.10.0/Readme'   => 'perl/Readme',
                      'perl-5.10.0/Artistic' => 'perl/Artistic',
                      'perl-5.10.0/Copying'  => 'perl/Copying',
              },
              install_to => 'perl',
            );

    The "install_perl_*_bin" method takes care of the detailed process of
    building the Perl binary and installing it into the distribution.

    A short summary of the process would be that it downloads or otherwise
    fetches the named package, unpacks it, copies out any license files from
    the source code, then tweaks the Win32 makefile to point to the specific
    build directory, and then runs make/make test/make install. It also
    registers some environment variables for addition to the Inno Setup
    script.

    It is normally called directly by "install_perl_*" rather than directly
    from the API, but is documented for completeness.

    It takes a number of parameters that are sufficiently detailed above.

    Returns true (after 20 minutes or so) or throws an exception on error.

   install_dmake
      $dist->install_dmake

    The "install_dmake" method installs the dmake make tool into the
    distribution, and is typically installed during "C toolchain" build
    phase.

    It provides the approproate arguments to "install_binary" and then
    validates that the binary was installed correctly.

    Returns true or throws an exception on error.

   install_gcc
      $dist->install_gcc

    The "install_gcc" method installs the GNU C Compiler into the
    distribution, and is typically installed during "C toolchain" build
    phase.

    It provides the appropriate arguments to several "install_binary" calls.
    The default "install_gcc" method installs two binary packages, the core
    compiler 'gcc-core' and the C++ compiler 'gcc-c++'.

    Returns true or throws an exception on error.

   install_binutils
      $dist->install_binutils

    The "install_binutils" method installs the "GNU binutils" package into
    the distribution.

    The most important of these is "dlltool.exe", which is used to extract
    static library files from .dll files. This is needed by some libraries
    to let the Perl interfaces build against them correctly.

    Returns true or throws an exception on error.

   install_pexports
      $dist->install_pexports

    The "install_pexports" method installs the "MinGW pexports" package into
    the distribution.

    This is needed by some libraries to let the Perl interfaces build
    against them correctly.

    Returns true or throws an exception on error.

   install_mingw_runtime
      $dist->install_mingw_runtime

    The "install_mingw_runtime" method installs the MinGW runtime package
    into the distribution, which is basically the MinGW version of libc and
    some other very low level libs.

    Returns true or throws an exception on error.

   install_zlib
      $dist->install_zlib

    The "install_zlib" method installs the GNU zlib compression library into
    the distribution, and is typically installed during "C toolchain" build
    phase.

    It provides the appropriate arguments to a "install_library" call that
    will extract the standard zlib win32 package, and generate the
    additional files that Perl needs.

    Returns true or throws an exception on error.

   install_win32api
      $dist->install_win32api

    The "install_win32api" method installs "MinGW win32api" layer, to allow
    C code to compile against native Win32 APIs.

    Returns true or throws an exception on error.

   install_mingw_make
      $dist->install_mingw_make

    The "install_mingw_make" method installs the MinGW build of the GNU make
    build tool.

    While GNU make is not used by Perl itself, some C libraries can't be
    built using the normal "dmake" tool and explicitly need GNU make. So we
    install it as mingw-make and certain Alien:: modules will use it by that
    name.

    Returns true or throws an exception on error.

   install_libiconv
      $dist->install_libiconv

    The "install_libiconv" method installs the "GNU libiconv" library, which
    is used for various character encoding tasks, and is needed for other
    libraries such as "libxml".

    Returns true or throws an exception on error.

   install_libxml
      $dist->install_libxml

    The "install_libxml" method installs the "Gnome libxml" library, which
    is a fast, reliable, XML parsing library, and the new standard library
    for XML parsing.

    Returns true or throws an exception on error.

   install_expat
      $dist->install_expat

    The "install_expat" method installs the "Expat" XML library, which was
    the first popular C XML parser. Many Perl XML libraries are based on
    Expat.

    Returns true or throws an exception on error.

   install_gmp
      $dist->install_gmp

    The "install_gmp" method installs the "GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic
    Library", which is used for fast and robust bignum support.

    Returns true or throws an exception on error.

   install_pari
      $dist->install_pari

    The "install_pari" method install (via a PAR package) libpari and the
    Math::Pari module into the distribution.

    This method should only be called at during the install_modules phase.

  General installation methods
   install_binary
            $self->install_binary(
                    name => 'gmp',
            );

    The "install_binary" method is used by library-specific methods to
    install pre-compiled and un-modified tar.gz or zip archives into the
    distribution.

    Returns true or throws an exception on error.

   install_library
      $self->install_library(
              name => 'gmp',
      );

    The "install_binary" method is used by library-specific methods to
    install pre-compiled and un-modified tar.gz or zip archives into the
    distribution.

    Returns true or throws an exception on error.

   install_distribution
            $self->install_distribution(
              name              => 'ADAMK/File-HomeDir-0.69.tar.gz,
              force             => 1,
              automated_testing => 1,
              makefilepl_param  => [
                      'LIBDIR=' . File::Spec->catdir(
                              $self->image_dir, 'c', 'lib',
                      ),
              ],
            );

    The "install_distribution" method is used to install a single CPAN or
    non-CPAN distribution directly, without installing any of the
    dependencies for that distribution.

    It is used primarily during CPAN bootstrapping, to allow the
    installation of the toolchain modules, with the distribution install
    order precomputed or hard-coded.

    It takes a compulsory 'name' param, which should be the AUTHOR/file path
    within the CPAN mirror.

    The optional 'force' param allows the installation of distributions with
    spuriously failing test suites.

    The optional 'automated_testing' param allows for installation with the
    "AUTOMATED_TESTING" environment flag enabled, which is used to either
    run more-intensive testing, or to convince certain Makefile.PL that
    insists on prompting that there is no human around and they REALLY need
    to just go with the default options.

    The optional 'makefilepl_param' param should be a reference to an array
    of additional params that should be passwd to the "perl Makefile.PL".
    This can help with distributions that insist on taking additional
    options via Makefile.PL.

    Distributions that do not have a Makefile.PL cannot be installed via
    this routine.

    Returns true or throws an exception on error.

   install_distribution_from_file
            $self->install_distribution_from_file(
              file              => 'c:\distdir\File-HomeDir-0.69.tar.gz',
              force             => 1,
              automated_testing => 1,
              makefilepl_param  => [
                      'LIBDIR=' . File::Spec->catdir(
                              $self->image_dir, 'c', 'lib',
                      ),
              ],
            );

    The "install_distribution_from_file" method is used to install a single
    CPAN or non-CPAN distribution directly, without installing any of the
    dependencies for that distribution, from disk.

    It takes a compulsory 'file' param, which should be the location of the
    distribution on disk.

    The optional 'force' param allows the installation of distributions with
    spuriously failing test suites.

    The optional 'automated_testing' param allows for installation with the
    "AUTOMATED_TESTING" environment flag enabled, which is used to either
    run more-intensive testing, or to convince certain Makefile.PL that
    insists on prompting that there is no human around and they REALLY need
    to just go with the default options.

    The optional 'makefilepl_param' param should be a reference to an array
    of additional params that should be passwd to the "perl Makefile.PL".
    This can help with distributions that insist on taking additional
    options via Makefile.PL.

    Distributions that do not have a Makefile.PL cannot be installed via
    this routine.

    Returns true or throws an exception on error.

   install_module
      $self->install_module(
              name => 'DBI',
      );

    The "install_module" method is a high level installation method that can
    be used during the "install_perl_modules" phase, once the CPAN toolchain
    has been been initialized.

    It makes the installation call using the CPAN client directly, allowing
    the CPAN client to both do the installation and fulfill all of the
    dependencies for the module, identically to if it was installed from the
    CPAN shell via an "install Module::Name" command.

    The compulsory 'name' param should be the class name of the module to be
    installed.

    The optional 'force' param can be used to force the install of module.
    This does not, however, force the installation of the dependencies of
    the module.

    The optional 'packlist' param sshould be 0 if a .packlist file is not
    installed with the module.

    Returns true or throws an exception on error.

   install_modules
      $self->install_modules( qw{
              Foo::Bar
              This::That
              One::Two
      } );

    The "install_modules" method is a convenience shorthand that makes it
    trivial to install a series of modules via "install_module".

    As a convenience, it does not support any additional params to the
    underlying "install_module" call other than the name.

   install_par
    The "install_par" method extends the available installation options to
    allow for the install of pre-compiled modules and pre-compiled C
    libraries via "PAR" packages.

    The compulsory 'name' param should be a simple identifying name, and
    does not have any functional use.

    The compulsory 'uri' param should be a URL string to the PAR package.

    Returns true on success or throws an exception on error.

   install_file
      # Overwrite the CPAN::Config
      $self->install_file(
              share      => 'Perl-Dist CPAN_Config.pm',
              install_to => 'perl/lib/CPAN/Config.pm',
      );
      
  # Install a custom icon file
      $self->install_file(
              name       => 'Strawberry Perl Website Icon',
              url        => 'http://strawberryperl.com/favicon.ico',
              install_to => 'Strawberry Perl Website.ico',
      );

    The "install_file" method is used to install a single specific file from
    various sources into the distribution.

    It is generally used to overwrite modules with distribution-specific
    customisations, or to install licenses, README files, or other
    miscellaneous data files which don't need to be compiled or modified.

    It takes a variety of different params.

    The optional 'name' param provides an optional plain name for the file.
    It does not have any functional purpose or meaning for this method.

    One of several alternative source methods must be provided.

    The 'url' method is used to provide a fully-resolved path to the source
    file and should be a fully-resolved URL.

    The 'file' method is used to provide a local path to the source file on
    the local system, and should be a fully-resolved filesystem path.

    The 'share' method is used to provide a path to a file installed as part
    of a CPAN distribution, and accessed via File::ShareDir.

    It should be a string containing two space-seperated value, the first of
    which is the distribution name, and the second is the path within the
    share dir of that distribution.

    The final compulsory method is the 'install_to' method, which provides
    either a destination file path, or alternatively a path to an existing
    directory that the file be installed below, using its source file name.

    Returns true or throws an exception on error.

   install_launcher
      $self->install_launcher(
              name => 'CPAN Client',
              bin  => 'cpan',
      );

    The "install_launcher" method is used to describe a binary program
    launcher that will be added to the Windows "Start" menu when the
    distribution is installed.

    It takes two compulsory param.

    The compulsory 'name' param is the name of the launcher, and the text
    that label will be displayed in the start menu (Currently this only
    supports ASCII, and is not language-aware in any way).

    The compulsory 'bin' param should be the name of a .bat script launcher
    in the Perl bin directory. The program itself MUST be installed before
    trying to add the launcher.

    Returns true or throws an exception on error.

   install_website
      $self->install_website(
              name       => 'Strawberry Perl Website',
              url        => 'http://strawberryperl.com/',
              icon_file  => 'Strawberry Perl Website.ico',
              icon_index => 1,
      );

    The "install_website" param is used to install a "Start" menu entry that
    will load a website using the default system browser.

    The compulsory 'name' param should be the name of the website, and will
    be the labelled displayed in the "Start" menu.

    The compulsory 'url' param is the fully resolved URL for the website.

    The optional 'icon_file' param should be the path to a file that
    contains the icon for the website.

    The optional 'icon_index' param should be the icon index within the icon
    file. This param is optional even if the 'icon_file' param has been
    provided, by default the first icon in the file will be used.

    Returns true on success, or throws an exception on error.

  write_zip
    The "write_zip" method is used to generate a standalone .zip file
    containing the entire distribution, for situations in which a full
    installer executable is not wanted (such as for "Portable Perl" type
    installations).

    The executable file is written to the output directory, and the location
    of the file is printed to STDOUT.

    Returns true or throws an exception or error.

DIAGNOSTICS
    Note that most errors are defined as exception objects in the PDWiX,
    PDWiX::Parameter, and PDWiX::Caught classes. Those errors will start
    with "Perl::Dist::WiX error:"

    Some parameter errors will be caught by Object::InsideOut. (Those errors
    will be in the OIO class, and are not listed here.)

  "Perl::Dist::WiX error:"
    "Parameter missing or invalid"
        (Implemented as a PDWiX::Parameter class)

        The parameter mentioned is either missing (and it is required) or
        invalid (for example, a string where an integer is required).

        Often, but not always, exactly why the parameter is invalid is
        mentioned, as well.

    "Internal Error: Missing or invalid id"
        A Perl::Dist::WiX::Base::Component has been created with a missing
        or invalid id parameter. This should not happen.

    "Internal Error: Calling as_string improperly (most likely, not calling
    derived method)"
        Perl::Dist::WiX::Base::Component->as_spaces is being called instead
        of one of its derived methods.

    "Internal Error: Odd number of parameters to add_directories_id"
        The Perl::Dist::WiX->add_directories_id method takes pairs of
        directories and the id to use when adding them. Somehow, these got
        mismatched.

    "Can't add the directories required"
        The directories that are requested to be added under this directory
        object aren't a subdirectory of the directory being referred to by
        the directory object, so directory objects cannot be created within
        this object for them.

    "Internal Error: Parameters not passed in hash reference"
        The method referred to takes all its parameters as a hash reference
        (i.e. within "{ }" brackets) and this was not done.

    "Can't create intermediate directories when creating %s (unsuccessful
    search for %s)"
        Perl::Dist::WiX::Directory->add_directory could not find a directory
        object to add the new directory object to. (add_directory can only
        create a directory object immediately under another one.)

    "Complex feature tree not implemented in Perl::Dist::WiX %s."
        Having more than one feature (and supporting conditional
        installation of features by the user) has not been implemented in
        Perl::Dist::WiX at this point.

    "Error reading directory %s: %s"
        Something happened when attempting to get a list of files for the
        directory mentioned.

    "Error reading packlist file %s: %s"
        Something happened when attempting to read the packlist file
        mentioned.

    "Could not add %s"
        The file to be added to the Perl distribution was completely outside
        the distribution's directories, so a directory object could not be
        found to refer to.

    "The output_dir directory is not writable"
        The directory specified by the "output_dir" parameter is not
        writable by the current user. Specify a different directory, or have
        your administrator set the directory so it can be written to.

    "%s does not exist or is not readable"
        Trying to use light.exe to compile a file that cannot be read or it
        does not exist (someone may be trying to modify your file system
        from under you?)

    "Failed to find %s (Probably compilation error in %s)"
        The first file mentioned could not be found. There was probably a
        error in compilation of the second file.

    "Could not open file %s for writing [$!] [$^E]"
        Perl::Dist::WiX could not open the file mentioned. The reason should
        be specified within the brackets.

    "Fragment %s does not exist"
        An attempt to add a file or files to a fragment that had not been
        created yet has been detected.

    "%s does not support Perl %s" or "Cannot generate perl, missing $s
    method in %s"
        You are attempting to install a version of the perl interpreter that
        Perl::Dist::WiX does not support yet. If this is a new version of
        the interpreter, or if Perl::Dist::WiX is documented as supporting
        this version of the interpreter, please report this as a bug.

    "Failed to resolve Module::CoreList hash for %s"
        We could not get a hash of modules from Module::Corelist for the
        version of Perl mentioned.

    "Unknown package %s"
        An improper package name was passed to Perl::Dist::WiX->binary_url.

    "Checkpoints require a temp_dir to be set"
        There was no "temp_dir" parameter set and a checkpoint routine was
        called.

    "Failed to find checkpoint directory"
        Perl::Dist::WiX->checkpoint_load could not find a directory
        "temp_dir"\checkpoint to load a checkpoint from.

        Either a checkpoint was never saved, or the temporary directory is
        different, or the checkpoint was deleted.

    "Did not provide a toolchain resolver"
        A Perl::Dist::Util::Toolchain object was not passed to
        Perl::Dist::WiX->install_perl_toolchain, and that method was unable
        to create one.

    "Cannot install CPAN modules yet, perl is not installed"
        Perl::Dist::WiX->install_cpan_upgrades was called before
        Perl::Dist::WiX->install_perl.

    "CPAN script %s failed"
        An error happened creating or executing the script to upgrade or
        install a CPAN module. The error will usually be mentioned on this
        line, and the debug.err and debug.out files (in the "output_dir")
        can be examined for assistance in determining what happened.

    "Failure detected during cpan upgrade, stopping [%s]" or "Failure
    detected installing %s, stopping [%s]"
        The script to upgrade or install a CPAN module reported an error.
        The error will usually be mentioned on this line, and the debug.err
        and debug.out files (in the "output_dir") can be examined for
        assistance in determining what happened.

    "Cannot build Perl yet, dmake has not been installed"
        install_dmake needs to be ran before install_perl.

    "Can't execute %s"
        We just installed something, but a test to make sure that it is
        executable did not pass.

    "Didn't expect install_to to be a %s"
        The "install_to" parameter was the wrong type. It either needs to be
        a hashref of directory mappings or a directory to install to.

    "Failed to extract %s"
        Perl::Dist::WiX->install_distribution or
        Perl::Dist::WiX->install_distribution_from_file could not extract
        the file referred to. The file may be corrupt.

    "Could not find Makefile.PL in %s"
        This module did not have a Makefile.PL when it was unpacked.

        If it has only a Build.PL, it can be installed by install_module or
        install_modules, but not install_distribution. Otherwise, there was
        probably an extraction error.

    "No .packlist found for %s. ..."
        When this module was being installed, Perl::Dist::WiX was looking
        for a packlist in order to create a fragment for the module.

        The description given with this error tells how to tell
        Perl::Dist::WiX to create the fragment another way.

    "Template processing failed for $from_tt"
        Perl::Dist::WiX->patch_file tried to use the template $from_tt to
        create a patch, and the patch creation failed.

    "Missing or invalid file $file or $file_tt in pathlist search"
        Perl::Dist::WiX->patch_file tried to find a file with these two
        names to create a patch, and the patch creation failed.

    "Failed to find file $file"
        Perl::Dist::WiX->patch_file could not find the file to patch.

    "Failed to create $dir"
        Perl::Dist::WiX tried to create a directory to cache the downloaded
        modules in, and the creastion failed.

    "No write permissions for LWP::UserAgent cache '$dir'"
        Perl::Dist::WiX created a directory to cache the downloaded modules
        in, but it can't write to the cache directory.

    "make failed" or "perl failed"
        Trying to execute make or perl failed.

    "make failed (OS error)" or "perl failed (OS error)"
        When make or perl was executed, an error was reported. Check the
        debug.out and debug.err files for more information.

    "CPAN modules file error: $!"
        In Perl::Dist::WiX->install_module, we expected a file to be created
        to verify that CPAN could find the module to be installed. When
        install_module tried to read the file, we got the error reported.

    "The script %s does not exist"
        Install_launcher could not find a script at this location when
        creating a shortcut.

    "PATH directory $dir does not exist"
        The directory being added to the PATH does not exist.

    "Directory $path does not exist"
        We tried to find the path to get patches from with
        Perl::Dist::WiX->patch_include_path, but the path to get the patches
        from does not exist.

    "Copy error: %s" or "Move error: %s"
        There was an error copying or moving a file.

    "Error in archive extraction"
        The archive that was downloaded was corrupt when an extraction
        attempt was made.

    "Didn't recognize archive type for $archive"
        Perl::Dist::WiX can only install files with a .zip or .tar.gz
        extension.

    "%s has not been installed"
        The install_* routine that adds this particular package needed to be
        called before this one, but it wasn't.

    "pexports failed to generate .def file" or "pexports failed to generate
    .a file"
        pexports or dlltool had an error and was not able to generate the
        file required.

    "Failed to make_path for %s" or "Failed to remake_path for %s"
        The directory did not exist once made or remade.

    "Could not write out $filename_in: File already exists."
        The application name (as defined by the app_name parameter)
        conflicts with one of the other fragments somehow. Please choose a
        different application name.

  "Error caught by Perl::Dist::WiX from other module:"
    These exceptions are members of the PDWiX::Caught class.

    The specific problem returned from the other module is reported on the
    next line.

    "Unknown delegation error occured"
        This error occurs after "Completed install_c_libraries in %i
        seconds" if "trace => 0" or "Pregenerating toolchain..." if "trace
        => 1" or greater.

    "Failed to generate toolchain distributions"
        Perl::Dist::Util::Toolchain was not able to find out which modules
        need upgraded in the CPAN toolchain.

    "Template error"
        There was a problem creating or processing the main .wxs template.

    "Could not find distribution directory for Perl::Dist::WiX"
        File::ShareDir could not find the directory that Perl::Dist::WiX
        uses to store its required data
        ("$Config{sitelib}\auto\share\Perl-Dist-WiX")

    As other errors are noticed, they will be listed here.

  "OIO::Args error: Missing mandatory initializer '%s' for class '%s'"
    This is the Object::InsideOut equivalent of a PDWiX::Parameter error.

TODO
    1.  Need to add custom action to delete leftover files from perl
        installation (0.172)

    2.  Handle installing distributions that only contain a Build.PL by
        executing the Build.PL (instead of throwing an exception) in
        install_distribution. (0.180)

    3.  Create a distribution for handling the XML-generating parts of
        Perl::Dist::WiX and depend on it (0.180? 0.190?)
