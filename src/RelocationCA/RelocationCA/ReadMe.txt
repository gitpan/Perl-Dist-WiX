This is a Visual Studio 2005 solution for the Relocation Custom Action 
required for installations of perl.

(unfortunately, the version of MingW that Strawberry Perl uses does not have the 
libraries required to compile a custom action. So Visual Studio it is.)

The compiled version will be in Perl-Dist-WiX-x.xxx.tar.gz/share/RelocationCA.dll.
