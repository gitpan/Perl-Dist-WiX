=head1 NAME

Perl::Dist::WiX::Repository - The repository that is used for Perl::Dist::WiX.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This documentation describes the repository that Perl::Dist::WiX uses, and 
the branches that are currently being used as of March 2010.

=head1 REPOSITORY

Perl::Dist::WiX is currently on Adam Kennedy's "Open Repository" for CPAN 
authors, at L<http://svn.ali.as/cpan/>

My understanding is that if you're a CPAN author, you can get commit access 
to it by asking Adam Kennedy for it. His e-mail address is 
C<< adamk@cpan.org >>.

If you aren't a CPAN author and need commit access for Perl::Dist::WiX, please 
e-mail me with what you'd like to do (a patch would be nice) and I'll 
recommend to him that you be given access.

In any case, before committing anything more than minor changes to the 
Perl-Dist-WiX trunk or current branches, please e-mail me.  I'll probably 
say yes, but I need to know what you're planning to do, so that I don't 
accidentally step on your changes.

You may wish to work on your own branch, and then communicate with me to 
get it merged into the trunk, by doing:

	svn cp http://svn.ali.as/trunk/Perl-Dist-WiX/ http://svn.ali.as/branches/Perl-Dist-WiX/<branch_name>

=head1 BRANCHES

=head2 Trunk 

Location: L<http://svn.ali.as/cpan/trunk/Perl-Dist-WiX/>

The trunk right now has 3 goals for April 2010:

=over

=item 1.

Relocatability (being able to install Strawberry Perl to any location).
This work is being done on the trunk.

A perl script for .zip file relocation has been included, and it is
temporarily being used in the .msi as well. A custom action will be 
included post-April 2010 Beta 1.

This only works with 5.11.x versions of perl or above at the present
time (there is a bug files on rt.perl.org on 5.10.1.)

=item 2.

5.12.x support, once the 5.12.0 version of perl is released.
Currently 5.11.5 is the supported development version, in order to
help prepare for this.

=item 3.

Updating toolchain for gcc 4.4.3 from, to go along with 5.12.x support.
Most of this has been completed.

=item 4.

Updated libraries, built with gcc 4.4.3. Most of this has been completed, 
as well.

The 32-bit libraries will work with the old gcc 3.3.5 toolchain, as well.

=back

=head2 January 2009 maintenance branch.

Location: L<http://svn.ali.as/cpan/branches/Perl-Dist-WiX/January-2009-maintenance/>

This branch exists for the sole purpose of rebuilding Strawberry Perl 5.8.9 
and 5.10.1 if there are major problems before April 2010. Changes on this 
branch are HIGHLY discouraged.

This branch will be deleted upon the release of the April 2010 versions 
of Strawberry Perl, and a new branch will be created to maintain that 
version.
