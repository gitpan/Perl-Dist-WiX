=head1 BRANCHES

=head2 default 

The trunk right now has 4 goals for June 2011:

=over

=item 1.

Continuing to increase the 'pluggability' the supported versions of Perl pluggable. This way, the 
C<Perl::Dist::WiX> distribution itself is smaller.

=item 2.

5.14.0 support (when it comes out).

=item 3.

Making what distroprefs we have inheritable (probably by making a 
subdirectory of the build directory to copy them into.)

=item 4.

Being able to have a "feature tree".

=back

=head2 maint-May2011 (May 2011 maintenance branch.)

This branch exists for the sole purpose of rebuilding Strawberry Perl 5.10.1 
and 5.12.3 if there are major problems before August 2011. Changes on this 
branch are HIGHLY discouraged.

This branch will end upon the release of the October 2010 versions 
of Strawberry Perl, and a new branch will be created to maintain that 
version.
