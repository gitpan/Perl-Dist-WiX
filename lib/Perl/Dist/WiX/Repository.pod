=head1 NAME

Perl::Dist::WiX::Repository - The repository that is used for Perl::Dist::WiX.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This documentation describes the repository that Perl::Dist::WiX uses, and 
the branches that are currently being used as of September 2009.

=head1 REPOSITORY

Perl::Dist::WiX is currently on Adam Kennedy's "Open Repository" for CPAN 
authors, at L<http://svn.ali.as/cpan/>

My understanding is that if you're a CPAN author, you can get commit access 
to it by asking Adam Kennedy for it. His e-mail address is 
C<< adamk@cpan.org >>.

If you aren't a CPAN author and need commit access for Perl::Dist::WiX, please 
e-mail me with what you'd like to do (a patch would be nice) and I'll 
recommend to him that you be given access.

In any case, before committing anything more than minor changes to the 
Perl-Dist-WiX trunk or current branches, please e-mail me.  I'll probably 
say yes, but I need to know what you're planning to do, so that I don't 
accidentally step on your changes.

You may wish to work on your own branch, and then communicate with me to 
get it merged into the trunk, by doing:

	svn cp http://svn.ali.as/trunk/Perl-Dist-WiX/ http://svn.ali.as/branches/Perl-Dist-WiX/<branch_name>

=head1 BRANCHES

The trunk is currently unstable at the moment, due to the fact that the code 
is in the process of changing from using L<Object::InsideOut|Object::InsideOut>
and L<Object::Tiny|Object::Tiny> to L<Moose|Moose>.

Yes, I know Moose is "heavy" in the dependencies and initial loading time. 
The problems are that Object::Tiny is a little TOO tiny for what I need, 
and Object::InsideOut objects that contain other Object::InsideOut objects 
are very difficult to make L<Storable>, which breaks checkpointing.

Plus, with Moose, I gain the ability to check constructor parameters better,
the ability to extend logging, and the ability to factor out most of the XML 
generation and handling to another distribution in an easier matter.

So here are the branches:

=head2 Trunk 

Location: L<http://svn.ali.as/cpan/trunk/Perl-Dist-WiX/>

The trunk right now has 5 goals for October:

=over

=item 1.

5.10.1 support. (has been completed)

=item 2.

Moosification. (This is in process, but has been taken as far as required 
for October.)

=item 3.

Refactoring the WiX.pm and Installer.pm modules into smaller modules. (This 
is in process, but has been taken as far as required for October.)

=item 4.

Including the Perl::Dist::Asset and Perl::Dist::Util sets of modules into 
the Perl::Dist::WiX distribution. (has been completed)

=item 5.

To support installation into the 'vendor' portion of Perl's module 
installation area, instead of using the 'site' portion. (has been completed)

=back

=head2 July 2009 maintenance branch.

Location: L<http://svn.ali.as/cpan/branches/Perl-Dist-WiX/July-2009-maintenance/>

This branch exists for the sole purpose of rebuilding Strawberry Perl 5.8.9 
and 5.10.0 if there are major problems before October 2009. Changes on this 
branch are HIGHLY discouraged.
