# Installing C Toolchain and Library Packages

=pod

=head2 install_dmake

  $dist->install_dmake

The C<install_dmake> method installs the B<dmake> make tool into the
distribution, and is typically installed during "C toolchain" build
phase.

It provides the approproate arguments to C<install_binary> and then
validates that the binary was installed correctly.

Returns true or throws an exception on error.

=cut

sub install_dmake {
	my $self = shift;

	# Install dmake
	my $filelist = $self->install_binary(
		name    => 'dmake',
		license => {
			'dmake/COPYING'            => 'dmake/COPYING',
			'dmake/readme/license.txt' => 'dmake/license.txt',
		},
		install_to => {
			'dmake/dmake.exe' => 'c/bin/dmake.exe',
			'dmake/startup'   => 'c/bin/startup',
		},
	);

	# Initialize the make location
	$self->{bin_make} =
	  catfile( $self->image_dir, 'c', 'bin', 'dmake.exe' );
	unless ( -x $self->bin_make ) {
		PDWiX->throw(q{Can't execute make});
	}

	$self->insert_fragment( 'dmake', $filelist );

	return 1;
} ## end sub install_dmake

=pod

=head2 install_gcc

  $dist->install_gcc

The C<install_gcc> method installs the B<GNU C Compiler> into the
distribution, and is typically installed during "C toolchain" build
phase.

It provides the appropriate arguments to several C<install_binary>
calls. The default C<install_gcc> method installs two binary
packages, the core compiler 'gcc-core' and the C++ compiler 'gcc-c++'.

Returns true or throws an exception on error.

=cut

sub install_gcc {
	my $self = shift;

	# Install the compilers (gcc)
	my $fl = $self->install_binary(
		name    => 'gcc-core',
		license => {
			'COPYING'     => 'gcc/COPYING',
			'COPYING.lib' => 'gcc/COPYING.lib',
		},
	);

	$self->insert_fragment( 'gcc_core', $fl );

	$fl = $self->install_binary( name => 'gcc-g++', );

	$self->insert_fragment( 'gcc_gplusplus', $fl );

	return 1;
} ## end sub install_gcc

=pod

=head2 install_binutils

  $dist->install_binutils

The C<install_binutils> method installs the C<GNU binutils> package into
the distribution.

The most important of these is C<dlltool.exe>, which is used to extract
static library files from .dll files. This is needed by some libraries
to let the Perl interfaces build against them correctly.

Returns true or throws an exception on error.

=cut

sub install_binutils {
	my $self = shift;

	my $filelist = $self->install_binary(
		name    => 'binutils',
		license => {
			'Copying'     => 'binutils/Copying',
			'Copying.lib' => 'binutils/Copying.lib',
		},
	);
	$self->{bin_dlltool} =
	  catfile( $self->image_dir, 'c', 'bin', 'dlltool.exe' );
	unless ( -x $self->bin_dlltool ) {
		PDWiX->throw(q{Can't execute dlltool});
	}

	$self->insert_fragment( 'binutils', $filelist );

	return 1;
} ## end sub install_binutils

=pod

=head2 install_pexports

  $dist->install_pexports

The C<install_pexports> method installs the C<MinGW pexports> package
into the distribution.

This is needed by some libraries to let the Perl interfaces build against
them correctly.

Returns true or throws an exception on error.

=cut

sub install_pexports {
	my $self = shift;

	my $filelist = $self->install_binary(
		name       => 'pexports',
		url        => $self->binary_url('pexports-0.43-1.zip'),
		license    => { 'pexports-0.43/COPYING' => 'pexports/COPYING', },
		install_to => { 'pexports-0.43/bin' => 'c/bin', },
	);
	$self->{bin_pexports} =
	  catfile( $self->image_dir, 'c', 'bin', 'pexports.exe' );
	unless ( -x $self->bin_pexports ) {
		PDWiX->throw(q{Can't execute pexports});
	}

	$self->insert_fragment( 'pexports', $filelist );

	return 1;
} ## end sub install_pexports

=pod

=head2 install_mingw_runtime

  $dist->install_mingw_runtime

The C<install_mingw_runtime> method installs the MinGW runtime package
into the distribution, which is basically the MinGW version of libc and
some other very low level libs.

Returns true or throws an exception on error.

=cut

sub install_mingw_runtime {
	my $self = shift;

	my $filelist = $self->install_binary(
		name    => 'mingw-runtime',
		license => {
			'doc/mingw-runtime/Contributors' => 'mingw/Contributors',
			'doc/mingw-runtime/Disclaimer'   => 'mingw/Disclaimer',
		},
	);

	$self->insert_fragment( 'mingw_runtime', $filelist );

	return 1;
} ## end sub install_mingw_runtime

=pod

=head2 install_win32api

  $dist->install_win32api

The C<install_win32api> method installs C<MinGW win32api> layer, to
allow C code to compile against native Win32 APIs.

Returns true or throws an exception on error.

=cut

sub install_win32api {
	my $self = shift;

	my $filelist = $self->install_binary( name => 'w32api', );

	$self->insert_fragment( 'w32api', $filelist );

	return 1;
}

=pod

=head2 install_mingw_make

  $dist->install_mingw_make

The C<install_mingw_make> method installs the MinGW build of the B<GNU make>
build tool.

While GNU make is not used by Perl itself, some C libraries can't be built
using the normal C<dmake> tool and explicitly need GNU make. So we install
it as mingw-make and certain Alien:: modules will use it by that name.

Returns true or throws an exception on error.

=cut

sub install_mingw_make {
	my $self = shift;

	my $filelist = $self->install_binary( name => 'mingw-make', );

	$self->insert_fragment( 'mingw_make', $filelist );

	return 1;
}
