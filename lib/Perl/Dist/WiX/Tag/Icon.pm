=head1 NAME

Perl::Dist::WiX::Tag::Icon - <Icon> tag that stores its type of target.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	my $tag = Perl::Dist::WiX::Tag::Icon->new(
		sourcefile  => catfile($dist->dist_dir(), 'padre.ico'),
		target_type => 'exe',
		id          => 'padre.exe.ico' # I_ is prepended to this.
	);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is an XML tag that specifies an icon that is used in a Perl::Dist::WiX 
based distribution.

=head1 METHODS

This class is a L<WiX3::XML::Icon> and inherits its API, so only additional 
API is documented here.

=head2 new

The C<new> constructor takes a series of parameters, validates then
and returns a new B<Perl::Dist::WiX::Tag::Icon> object.

If an error occurs, it throws an exception.

It inherits all the parameters described in the 
L<WiX3::XML::Icon> C<new> method documentation, and adds one additional 
parameter.

=item target_type

The required string C<target_type> param stores the extension of the target 
of a shortcut icon, or 'msi' if this is the icon for the msi.
