  Task::Kensho had a few mistakes in its Makefile.PL (already
  corrected in its repository).

match:
  distribution: |
    ^(?x:
    .^   # never matches, only purpose is to let things align nicely
    |PERIGRIN/Task-Kensho-0.22.tar.gz          # Needs a patch to install.
    )|
patches:
    - "Task-Kensho-0.22.patch"
